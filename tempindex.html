        <p>On <strong>Jupiter's moon Io</strong>, the <strong>ANDOR Corporation</strong> has been manufacturing heavy machinery and robot parts for all of the major Houses in the solar system. But during the latest skirmish between <strong>House Calypso</strong> and the <strong>Ganymede Steadfast</strong>, ANDOR's corporate headquarters suddenly went dark. Comms in <strong>Epaphos City</strong> are dark and that entire section of the Jovian grid has gone <strong>offline.</strong></p><br>
        <p>You are an agent of the <strong>Helios Authority</strong>, the watchdog group that <strong>polices</strong> the separate but confederated Houses on all the worlds of <strong>the Sol planetary system</strong>. You have been sent on a mission to discover what is going on in Epaphos City, what has happened to the <strong>ruling council</strong> there, and what the disposition is of <strong>ANDOR's corporate warlords</strong>.</p><br>
          <p>The job is not without danger. After all, you are <strong>the twelth agent</strong> to be dispatched to this moon. The others have <strong>never returned . . .</strong></p>
